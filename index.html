  <h1>Smart contract</h1>
  <hr>
  <h5>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h5></a>
  <p>A <strong>smart contract</strong>is a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program>computer program</a>
    or a transaction protocol which is intended to automatically execute,
    control or document legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an
    agreement.<sup><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract#cite_note-infobus-1>[1]</a></sup> <sup><a
          href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract#cite_note-conbook-2>[2]</a></sup> The
          objectives of smart contracts are the reduction of need in trusted intermediators,
          arbitrations and enforcement costs, fraud losses, as well as the reduction of malicious and accidental
          exceptions.

          Vending machines are mentioned as the oldest piece of technology equivalent to smart contract
          implementation.
          2014's <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_paper>white paper</a> about the <a

            describes the Bitcoin protocol as a weak version of the
            smart contract concept as defined by computer scientist, lawyer and cryptographer Nick Szabo. Since
            Ethereum,
            various cryptocurrencies support scripting languages which allow for more advanced smart contracts between
            untrusted
            parties. Smart contracts should be distinguished from smart legal contracts. The latter refers to a
            traditional
            natural language legally-binding agreement which has certain terms expressed and implemented in
            machine-readable
            code.</p>

  <h2>Etymology</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Smart contracts were first proposed in the early 1990s by Nick Szabo, who coined the term, using it to refer to "a
    set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on these
    promises". In 1998, the term was used to describe objects in rights management service layer of the system
    The Stanford Infobus, which was a part of Stanford Digital Library Project.</p>
  <p><a name="Legal status of smart contracts"></a></p>
  <h2>Legal status of smart contracts</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>A smart contract does not necessarily constitute a valid binding agreement at law. Some legal academics claim
    that smart contracts are not legal agreements, but rather means of performing obligations deriving from other
    agreements such as technological means for the automation of payment obligations or obligations consisting
    in the transfer of tokens or cryptocurrencies. Additionally, other scholars have argued that the imperative or
    declarative nature of programming languages can impact the legal validity of smart contracts.

    Since the 2015 launch of the Ethereum blockchain, the term "smart contract" has been more specifically applied
    toward the notion of general purpose computation that takes place on a blockchain or distributed ledger. The US
    National Institute of Standards and Technology describes a "smart contract" as a "collection of code and data
    (sometimes referred to as functions and state) that is deployed using cryptographically signed transactions on the
    blockchain network".[18] In this interpretation, used for example by the Ethereum Foundation[6] or IBM,[19] a smart
    contract is not necessarily related to the classical concept of a contract, but can be any kind of computer program.
    A smart contract also can be regarded as a secured stored procedure as its execution and codified effects like the
    transfer of some value between parties are strictly enforced and can not be manipulated, after a transaction with
    specific contract details is stored into a blockchain or distributed ledger. That's because the actual execution of
    contracts is controlled and audited by the platform, not by any arbitrary server-side programs connecting to the
    platform.

    In 2017, by implementing the Decree on Development of Digital Economy, Belarus has become the first-ever country to
    legalize smart contracts. Belarusian lawyer Denis Aleinikov is considered to be the author of a smart contract legal
    concept introduced by the decree.

    In 2018, a US Senate report said: "While smart contracts might sound new, the concept is rooted in basic contract
    law. Usually, the judicial system adjudicates contractual disputes and enforces terms, but it is also common to have
    another arbitration method, especially for international transactions. With smart contracts, a program enforces the
    contract built into the code." A number of states in the US have passed legislation on the use of smart
    contracts, such as Arizona,[24] Nevada, Tennessee, and Wyoming. And in April 2020,
    Iowa's House of Representatives passed a bill legally recognizing smart contacts in the state.

    In April 2021, the UK Jurisdiction Taskforce (UKJT) published the Digital Dispute Resolution Rules (the Digital DR
    Rules) to help enable the rapid resolution of blockchain and crypto legal disputes in Britain.</p>

  <h2>Workings</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Similar to a transfer of value on a blockchain, deployment of a smart contract on a blockchain occurs by sending a
    transaction from a wallet for the blockchain. The transaction includes the compiled code for the smart contract
    as well as a special receiver address. That transaction must then be included in a block that is added to the
    blockchain, at which point the smart contract's code will execute to establish the initial state of the smart
    contract. Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithms secure the smart contract in a decentralized way from attempts to
    tamper with it. Once a smart contract is deployed, it cannot be updated. Smart contracts on a blockchain can
    store arbitrary state and execute arbitrary computations. End clients interact with a smart contract through
    transactions. Such transactions with a smart contract can invoke other smart contracts. These transactions might
    result in changing the state and sending coins from one smart contract to another or from one account to
    another.

    The most popular blockchain for running smart contracts is Ethereum. On Ethereum, smart contracts are typically
    written in a Turing-complete programming language called Solidity, and compiled into low-level bytecode to be
    executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Due to the halting problem and other security problems,
    Turing-completeness is considered to be a risk and is deliberately avoided by languages like Vyper. Some of
    the other smart contract programming languages missing Turing-completeness are Simplicity, Scilla, Ivy and Bitcoin
    Script. However, measurements using regular expressions showed that only 35.3% of 53,757 Ethereum smart
    contracts included recursions and loops â€” constructs connected to the halting problem.

    Several languages are designed to enable formal verification: Bamboo, IELE, Simplicity, Michelson (can be verified
    with Coq), Liquidity (compiles to Michelson), Scilla, DAML and Pact.</p>

  <h2>Applications</h2>
  <hr>

  <p>In 1998, Szabo proposed that smart contract infrastructure can be implemented by replicated asset registries and
    contract execution using cryptographic hash chains and Byzantine fault-tolerant replication. Askemos implemented
    this approach in 2002 using Scheme (later adding SQLite) as contract script language.

    One proposal for using bitcoin for replicated asset registration and contract execution is called "colored
    coins". Replicated titles for potentially arbitrary forms of property, along with replicated contract execution,
    are implemented in different projects.

    As of 2015, UBS was experimenting with "smart bonds" that use the bitcoin blockchain in which payment streams
    could hypothetically be fully automated, creating a self-paying instrument.

    Inheritance wishes could hypothetically be implemented automatically upon registration of a death certificate by
    means of smart contracts. Birth certificates can also work together with smart contracts.[55][56]

    Smart contracts can also be used to handle real estate transactions  (i.e. via Propy, ...) and
    blockchain solutions are also proliferating on the field of title records and in the public
    register.

    Smart contracts can also be used in employment contracts, especially temporary employment contracts, offering
    benefits for both employer and employee.</p>

  <h2>Security issues</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>A blockchain-based smart contract is visible to all users of said blockchain. However, this leads to a situation
    where bugs, including security holes, are visible to all yet may not be quickly fixed. Such an attack, difficult
    to fix quickly, was successfully executed on The DAO in June 2016, draining approximately US$50 million worth of
    Ether at the time, while developers attempted to come to a solution that would gain consensus. The DAO program
    had a time delay in place before the hacker could remove the funds; a hard fork of the Ethereum software was done to
    claw back the funds from the attacker before the time limit expired. Other high-profile attacks include the
    Parity multisignature wallet attacks, and an integer underflow/overflow attack (2018), totaling over US$184
    million.

    Issues in Ethereum smart contracts, in particular, include ambiguities and easy-but-insecure constructs in its
    contract language Solidity, compiler bugs, Ethereum Virtual Machine bugs, attacks on the blockchain network, the
    immutability of bugs and that there is no central source documenting known vulnerabilities, attacks and problematic
    constructs.</p>

  <p><a name="Difference from smart legal contracts"></a></p>
  <h2>Difference from smart legal contracts</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Smart legal contracts are distinct from smart contracts. As mentioned above, a smart contract is not necessarily
    legally enforceable as a contract. On the other hand, a smart legal contract has all the elements of a legally
    enforceable contract in the jurisdiction in which it can be enforced and it can be enforced by a court or tribunal.
    Therefore, while every smart legal contract will contain some elements of a smart contract, not every smart contract
    will be a smart legal contract.

    There is no formal definition of a smart legal contract in the legal industry.[72]

    A Ricardian contract is a type of smart legal contract.</p>
